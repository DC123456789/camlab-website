biography = "Michael received a BA & Sc. from Quest University Canada where he worked on a phylogenetic analysis of two genes that have been linked to Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. As part of his thesis he also created an assignment aimed at introducing biology majors to the real of computational biology. Before graduating he joined the Eisenman lab at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center for a year where he worked on analyzing data genomic occupancy data surrounding the MYC transcription factor network. Now his work involves building machine learning models to better understand immune escape mechanisms in PDAC using all kinds of omics data."
