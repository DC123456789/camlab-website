biography = "Shanza received her HBSc from University of Toronto Mississauga majoring in Biology for Health Science and Mathematics. During her undergrad, Shanza undertook a bioinformatics and genomics research project with the Ness Lab at UTM looking at polymorphic transposable elements in the green algae, C. reinhardtii, which then became her senior thesis. She also worked on a Math research project with Dr. Jacopo De Simoi investigating the dynamical spectral rigidity of ellipses. Currently, Shanza is a PhD student in the Computational Biology for Molecular Genetics track at UofT and a Graduate Student at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute. She is supervised by Kieran Campbell and works in close collaboration with the Jackson lab. Her work involves the development of machine learning models for Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) data."
