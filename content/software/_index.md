##### Astir - Automated cell identity from single-cell multiplexed imaging and proteomics

_Astir_ is a modelling framework for the assignment of cell type across a range of single-cell highly mutliplexed imaging technologies such as Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC). _Astir_ is built using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html) and uses recognition networks for fast minibatch stochastic variational inference.
